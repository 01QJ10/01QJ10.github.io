Hi, I‚Äôm Qian Jun (QJ)! üëã

I‚Äôm a final-year Physics and Data Science undergraduate at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I love machine learning, deep learning, quantum computation, applied mathematics, and sciences in general. My current interests lie in multi-modal AI, computer vision, and world model.

Currently, I‚Äôm working on reduced-order modelling for fusion turbulence at A*STAR‚Äôs Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), and developing generative models for medical diagnostics at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).

Outside of tech, you‚Äôll find me bouldering, doing photography, or playing the piano. üé∂ üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üì∏

Always happy to collaborate or chat ‚Äî feel free to reach out!

[//]: <> Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[//]: <> Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]: <> Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
